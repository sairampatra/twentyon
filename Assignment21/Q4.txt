Callbacks and Promises are both used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, but they differ in their approach and capabilities.

Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions, which are then invoked upon completion of an asynchronous task. While callbacks provide a basic mechanism for handling asynchronous code, they suffer from issues like callback hell, where nested callbacks become difficult to manage and debug. Additionally, error handling with callbacks can be cumbersome, leading to code that is hard to read and maintain.

On the other hand, Promises provide a more structured and intuitive way to manage asynchronous code. Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow chaining of multiple asynchronous tasks in a more readable and sequential manner using methods like `.then()` and `.catch()`. Promises also offer built-in error handling through the `.catch()` method, which simplifies error management and makes code more robust.

Promises also enable better error propagation, allowing errors to bubble up the Promise chain until they are handled, which makes debugging easier. Furthermore, Promises support features like Promise.all() and Promise.race(), which enable more advanced asynchronous patterns.

Overall, Promises offer a more elegant and reliable solution for managing asynchronous code compared to callbacks, making them the preferred choice for modern JavaScript development.
