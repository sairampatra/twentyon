The XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object is a built-in JavaScript API that provides the ability to make HTTP requests from a web page to a server without having to reload the entire page. It is a core component of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) technology, which enables web pages to dynamically update content without requiring a full page reload.

Here's how the XMLHttpRequest object is typically used in AJAX:

1. **Create an Instance**: To use XMLHttpRequest, you create an instance of the object using the `new XMLHttpRequest()` constructor.

2. **Open Connection**: You specify the details of the HTTP request by calling the `open()` method on the XMLHttpRequest object. This method accepts parameters such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) and the URL of the server-side script or resource you want to communicate with.

3. **Set up Callbacks**: You define callback functions to handle the response from the server. These callbacks typically include an `onreadystatechange` event handler that is triggered whenever the state of the XMLHttpRequest object changes, as well as specific event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, and `ontimeout`.

4. **Send Request**: After setting up the XMLHttpRequest object and callbacks, you use the `send()` method to initiate the HTTP request. If you're making a POST request and need to send data to the server, you can pass the data as an argument to the `send()` method.

5. **Handle Response**: As the server processes the request and sends back a response, the callback functions you defined earlier are invoked. You can access the response data using properties like `responseText`, `responseXML`, or `response`.

6. **Update Page**: Finally, you use the response data received from the server to update the content of the web page dynamically, without requiring a full page reload.

Overall, the XMLHttpRequest object enables the asynchronous exchange of data between the client and server, allowing web applications to deliver a more responsive and interactive user experience.
